[CRUCIAL_INFORMATION_START]
IN PLC PROGRAM LOGIC, ACTUATING SOME OUTPUT UNTIL A CONDITION IS MET IS NOT DONE USING LOOPS.
THE PLC WILL EXECUTE THE CODE IN CYCLES. WE TRACK THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM THROUGH DIFFERENT CYCLES USING A STATE VARIABLE.
THE OUTPUT WILL REMAIN ACTIVATED UNTIL THE STATE VARIABLE IS CHANGED.
EACH FSM STATE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OPERATION. I.E A STATE CANNOT DO OEPRATION1 THEN OPERATION2. THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STATES.
