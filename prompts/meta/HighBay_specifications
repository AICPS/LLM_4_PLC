[OPERATION DESCRIPTION]:
    The Highbay contains 9 shelves arranged in a 3x3 matrix. Each shelf holds a component that the arm can lift.
    The arm can move in the horizontal and vertical axis. The arm can also move forward and backward.
    Horizontal axis is controlled by "HB HORIZ MOTOR POS" and "HB HORIZ MOTOR NEG".
    Horizontal axis is equipped with a two phase encoder. The encoder is connected to "HB HORIZ IMPULSE2" and "HB HORIZ POS IMPULSE1". The encoder is used to determine the position of the arm.
    Horizontal axis has a reference switch "HB REF HORIZ" that is used to determine the home position of the arm. xpos = 0 is the home position. I.E. when "HB REF HORIZ"=1 then xpos = 0.
    Vertical axis is controlled by "HB VERT MOTOR POS" and "HB VERT MOTOR NEG".
    Vertical axis is equipped with a two phase encoder. The encoder is connected to "HB VERT IMPULSE2" and "HB VERT IMPULSE1". The encoder is used to determine the position of the arm.
    Vertical axis has a reference switch "HB REF VERT" that is used to determine the home position of the arm. ypos = 0 is the home position. I.E. when "HB REF VERT"=1 then ypos = 0.
    The arm is controlled by "HB MOTOR ARM FRONT" and "HB MOTOR ARM BACK".
    The arm is equipped with two reference switches "HB ARM REF FRONT" and "HB ARM REF BACK". i.e. when "HB ARM REF FRONT"=1 then arm is in the front/extended position. i.e. when "HB ARM REF BACK"=1 then arm is in the back/retracted position.
    The offsets are as follows:
        ROW1X = 734
        ROW2X = 1315
        ROW3X = 1900
        COL1Y = 70
        COL2Y = 405
        COL3Y = 800
        lift_offset = 40
    e.g to lift a component from ROW1 COL2 the arm must travel to (734, 405), extend the arm, lift the component by lift_offset, retract the arm, and return to the home position.
    THE XY POSITION OF THE ARM CANNOT EXCEED THE BOUNDARIES OF THE SHELVES.
    To lift a component the arm must travel to the shelf (row_i, column_j), extend the arm, lift the component by lift_offset, retract the arm, and return to the home position.
    To place a component the arm must travel to the shelf (row_i, column_j + offset), extend the arm, lower the component by lift_offset, retract the arm, and return to the home position.
    The arm can only lift one component at a time.
    The arm can only place one component at a time.
    The arm can move simultaneously along the X, Y axis while holding a component or while empty.
    The arm must always be retracted before moving along the X, Y axis.
    The Encoder Impulse Pair is used to detect the direction of the movement: A positive edge on Impulse1 While Impulse2 is low indicates a positive movement. A positive edge on Impulse2 While Impulse1 is low indicates a negative movement.
[TASK]:
    When the user presses the red button, the arm travels to ROW1 COL2, lifts the component and travels to the home position.
    When the user presses the black button, the arm travels to ROW3 COL1, lifts the component and travels to the home position.
    Button presses while operating are ignored.
    When the user presses any button while holding a component, the arm travels to the component's home cell, places it and returns to the home position.
